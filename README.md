Voice to Image Generator Project using Dall-e

In this project, we build a real-time Voice-to-Image Generator using the concept of Generative AI. It is carried out in two steps:

Voice-to-text conversion - The speech is captured in real-time through the microphone and converted to text using state-of-the-art Opensource AI models from OpenAI and Whisper libraries.
Text to Image Generation - The converted text is provided as input to the state-of-the-art Image Generation models like Dalle-2, and the image is thus generated.

Here, the main ML models used are Whisper, GPT-3 and Dall-e with support of Kandi kit by Openweaver.
